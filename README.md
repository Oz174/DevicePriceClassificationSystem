# Device Price Range Classification System
## Project Description:
Build a Devices Price Classification System (AI System) using Python and SpringBoot. 
Mainly the system will include two small projects:
- Python project: will allow you to predict the prices, allowing the sellers to classify the device's prices according to their characteristics
- SpringBoot project: Will contain a simple entity, and a few endpoints, to call the service from the Python project for a bunch of test cases, and store them.
